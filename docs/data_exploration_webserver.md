Data exploration with tango's web interface
-------------------------------------------


Before completing this tutorial, you need to have set up _tangos_ and added the 
tutorial data to your first database. To skip adding the data, you can download the
[sample database](http://www.star.ucl.ac.uk/~app/tangos/tangos_data.db) here. Make sure the environment variable `TANGOS_DB_CONNECTION` 
contains the full path to this database (or just put it in your home folder as
`tangos_data.db`). 

Once that's done, enter the `tangos/web` folder and type `pserve production.ini`. You should
see some messages finishing with:
 
```
Serving on http://localhost:6543
```

Navigate your browser to that address to start playing. Click the video below to start a
tour of the data exploration features.
