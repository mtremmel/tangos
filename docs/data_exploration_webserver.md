Data exploration with tango's web interface
-------------------------------------------


Before completing this tutorial, you need to have set up _tangos_ and added the 
tutorial data to your first database. To skip adding the data, you can download the
tutorial database here (TODO: add link). Make sure the environment variable `TANGOS_DB_CONNECTION` 
contains the full path to this database (or just put it in your home folder as
`tangos_data.db`).
