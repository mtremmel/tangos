TANGOS - The Amazing Numerical Galaxy Organisation System
---------------------------------------------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pynbody/tangos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pynbody/tangos)

_Tangos_ is a system for building and querying databases summarising the
results of cosmological simulations. 

_Tangos_:

 - is written for python 2.7 and 3.5 or later;
 - provides a web interface to the data;
 - allows users to construct efficient, science-focussed queries from python without typing a line of SQL;
 - can be customised to work with multiple python modules such as pynbody or yt to process raw simulation data;
 - uses sqlalchemy to store the resulting data and therefore can connect to many different flavours of database.

 Getting started
