Data exploration with tangos
----------------------------

To see how _tangos_ can be used to explore your simulation data, you first need to 
[set up the package and paths](../README.md) and then ensure you have a working database in place.

For the latter, you can either follow the three [first steps](first_steps.md) tutorials which generate a database
from raw simulation data; or you can skip straight to the good stuff by downloading an 
[existing database](http://star.ucl.ac.uk/~app/tangos/tangos_data.db) where the three tutorial simulations have already been
imported.

Don't forget either `tangos_data.db` should be in your home folder or you need to set the environment variable
`TANGOS_DB_CONNECTION` appropriately; see the [set up instructions](../README.md).

Once all is ready, you can explore the data in one of two ways:

 * with the [_tangos_ web server](data_exploration_webserver.md);
 * or from [within python](Data%20exploration%20with%20python.ipynb).
